**Preferred Name:** Brooke \

![Crow Pose](https://github.com/BrookemWalters/preparation01/blob/main/Crow%20Pose.jpg?raw=true) \
Yoga is my happy place. My friend snapped this picture at just the right time. It appears I’m holding crow pose,  but in reality I immediately fell! 

### Education
**Current:** Data Science and Analytics Graduate Student \
**Previous:** BS. in Advertising and Public Relations & Minor: Business from Grand Valley State University

**Ideal Occupation:** Uncertain, but definitely in data! 

**Why DS&A:** The skills and concepts taught in this program are widely applicable. I thoroughly enjoy pulling insights from data and finding creative ways to translate these discoveries into visualizations. There are too many variables to state with certainty that I'll chase the offical job title of "Data Scientist," but merely completing the prerequisites and learning Python, SAS and Linear Regression have opened doors for me! 

[Andrew Yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Yang) inspired me continue my education with his book on the automation of work, [“The War on normal people.”](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36204293-the-war-on-normal-people?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=3CxGZZVjQQ&rank=1) More and more my responsibilities as a marketing analyst are becoming automated. Last summer I had an epiphany, *I could be the one creating automated workflows.*  

**Career History and Aspirations:**
 I recently left my role as a market research analyst in advertising for a senior business intelligence analyst role in healthcare. 
Short-term, I'm pivoting my reporting style from static written summaries to dynamic dashboards informing stakeholders on public health trends and predictions. \
***Funfact:** My first day of class was also my first day of at Spectrum Health*

**Why Stats 418/518:**
I’m here to gain rare and valuable skills. It would be foolish of me to not take advantage of the educational benefits I earned as veteran and through my employer.
I've grown to love working with data, but I'm at a point where my deficiencies in statistical theoretical knowledge and lack of technical abilities are barriers to my desired career path.
 
**Data Science Role Models:** [Build a Career in Data Science Podcast with Jacqueline Nolis and Emily Robinson
](https://anchor.fm/datascicareer) \
In this podcast Nolis and Robinson share their path to coming  data scientists and the types of projects they work on. They've inspired me to keep going even when I'm dismissed and not taken seriously by the data gatekeepers. 

**About me:** I'm willing to work hard to achieve my goals. Rarely am I the first person to understand new concepts and I'm slow at completing the related tasks - but I'm committed to mastering my craft and bruising my ego along the way.
