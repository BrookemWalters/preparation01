Yoga is my happy place. My friend snapped this picture at just the right time. It appears I’m holding crow pose,  but in reality I immediately fell! 

### Education
**Current:** Data Science and Analytics graduate student \
**Previous:** BS.in Advertising and Public Relations & Minor: Business *GVSU*

**Ideal Occupation:** Uncertain, but definitely in data! I choose to study DS&A because it’s growing, and the skills are widely applicable in many fields.

**Career History and Aspirations:**
On May 6th I left my role as a market research analyst in advertising for a senior business intelligence analyst role in healthcare. 
Short-term I want shift my deliveriables from static written summaries to dynamic dashboards informing stakeholders on public health trends and predictions. 
While I’m not sure if I want to be a data scientist, I know I love pulling insights from data and finding creative ways to translate these discoveries into visualizations.  


[Andrew Yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Yang) inspired me continue my education with his book on the automation of work called “The War on normal people.”  More and more my responsibilities as a marketing analyst are getting automated – I need the skills to be the one creating the automations!
