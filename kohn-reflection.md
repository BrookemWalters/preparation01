# Reflections

Letter grades motivate me.  They are the spoils of war after a semester long internal intellectual battle.  High marks are rewarded with credibility and access to scholarships through a universally recognized metric.

**Grades also serve as a barometer:** 
- *Do I know the material as well I think I do?*
- *Which concepts am I struggling with?*
- *Where do I focus my efforts?*
 
However, I agree with Kohn, **there has to be a better way!**
It is nearly impossible to separate the utility quantitative feedback plays in my quest for knowledge from my ego. The desire to obtain a perfect score often distracts me from my long-term goals of:
- improving my craft of data analysis 
- widening my perspective of the world, especially through a statistical lens 
- tackling difficult subjects through hard work and dedication 
- overall fulfillment through the pursuit of knowledge 

Considering all of these factors, I am so excited to use Github for Stats 518. It is a personal goal of mine to understand this platform, specifically to “level up” my collaboration skills and advance my career as a data analyst. Having the catalyst to finally build my portfolio and showcase high quality work is my North Star for this course.
